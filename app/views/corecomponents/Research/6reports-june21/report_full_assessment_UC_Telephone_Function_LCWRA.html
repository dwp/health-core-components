    has a history of Mental Health Problem.<br><br>
    For her Mental Health Problem, she is under the care of her GP. She has not been referred to a specialist. She was started on medication at time of diagnosis earlier this year. However, she has stopped taking this medication in the last week without informing her GP. Her typical day history shows that she has low mood and lack of motivation all of the time. She stays in bed all of the time, despite prompting to get up and out of bed from her family. She is encouraged to eat at every meal by her family, otherwise she would go without food. She used to previously like cooking and cleaning, however due to a deterioration in her mental health she no longer does this and her family do this. She neglects her self care and her daughter has to encourage and accompany her to wash and change her clothes. A full mental state examination was not possible as this was a telephone assessment and her daughter interpreted. She did not give any information herself, this was obtained from her daughter. Overall, based on history and medical knowledge, a severe disability with initiating and compteting personal actions seems likely.
