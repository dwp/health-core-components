    Advice<br>
    I advise that the client meets the criteria for treat as Limited capability for Work-related activity.<br>
    From the available evidence, the client is receiving or likely to receive in the next 6 months or recovering from treatment for cancer by way of chemotherapy or radiotherapy.<br><br>
    
    Justification of advice
    <br><br>
    Evidence indicates client has recently (January 2021) had a bowel cancer for which he has had an operation to resect the cancer and is now having adjuvant chemotherapy (started 31/3/2021 and will be given for 6 months).
    <br><br>
    Client therefore is currently having chemotherapy and this correlates with the information found in the cancer treatment page of the UC 50 which was signed by the clinical specialist nurse for oncology and the specialist letters which indicate the likelihood for the client to have recurrence of cancer and the need to have chemotherapy which client has commenced and continues to have and has been causing the client debilitating side effects.

    Why is this your recommendation?

  </dt>
  <dd class="govuk-summary-list__value"> Clients bowel cancer was staged to be advanced ( about stage 3) which may be associated with a slower recovery. This is iin combination with the fact that the client had some post operative Infections and is currently requiring chemotherapy ( Which according to the cancer treatment page of the UC 50 Is likely to cause side effects during and for several months after the treatment) for 6 months. The client has indicated that they are having debilitating side effects from the the chemotherapy and this Is likely to restrict the clients functions as indicated in the evidence, hence the review period. Also of consideration is the Covld-19 pandemic that may cause delays in reviews by the specialists. </div>
