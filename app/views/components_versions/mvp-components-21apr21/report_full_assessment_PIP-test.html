              Fibromyalgia- 2019<br>
              She was diagnosed with this in 2019 and she has had the symptoms for about 3-4 years following a tick bite. She saw the GP at the time and was given antibiotics, but after this it got worse and worse, she had revisited the GP with her symptoms several times. She was sent for a scan on her head which came back as fine. Her GP diagnosed her with fibromyalgia. Her symptoms include her legs feeling like pins and needles, stinging, her legs feel heavy and her arms also feel heavy and stinging. Her head can have sensations of pins and needles. She has pain in the arms and legs everyday. She states that she gets acid reflux and certain foods make this worse. She experiences tiredness easily but also doesn't sleep well due to pain. She has good and bad days with this, she feels her bad days are about 5 days out of 7 where her pain is worse. She-uses pain relief for this. No other treatment such as physiotherapy or acupuncture. She states that she is phoned weekly by a clinical psychologist and they talk about coping
              mechanisms and breathing, they are involved because of her fibromyalgia/ pain. She is under the pain management team and the clinical psychologist was recommended by her pain nurse. She has been to the pain clinic earlier this year, in about February and she was shown slides of how to manage her pain. The pain management nurse has phoned 2-3 times during the pandemic, but she recommended she work with the psychologist first before going back to them. She is not under the care of rheumatology. 
            <br><br>
            Underactive thyroid- 2018<br>
            This doesn't cause her any symptoms. This is well controlled on medication. She has regular blood tests to monitor her levels. Managed by her GP.
            <br><br>
            Depression/ Anxiety- 2019<br>
            She doesn't feel she does have depression, her GP thinks she has a little bit of depression. She has some anxiety that just makes her feel hot and on edge at certain times of the day and just feels she misses how she used to be. She has started wanting to check that things are locked several times. She has some days she doesn't want to see people. She doesn't have any variability with this and feels everyday is the same. She is given medication to aid her sleep but is also told this could help her anxiety. She will also mention her mental health to her clinical psychologist who deals with her pain as above. No input from the community mental health team, no psychiatrist or mental health nurse. No history of suicidal thoughts.
            <br><br>
            No other medical conditions reported.

                Her husband does the cooking. She has difficulty with standing for too long due to pain, she could stand for about 10 minutes and then would need to rest. She has difficulty with things like mashing potatoes as she doesn't have enough strength in the arms. She couldn't lift a heavy pot or pan and couldn't lift something heavy out of the oven. She is not able to peel and chop vegetables, she states this is because it is too hard to hold both the potato and the peeler and she finds it hard to coordinate things. She would be able to make herself things like sandwiches for herself. She is able to lift a kettle to make a drink. Unsure if she can lift light or empty pots and pans as she just doesn't do it. She is able to use a microwave and uses it often. She feels she also can't work out in her head the timings to make sure things were ready at the same time, unsure why this is but she feels that there is just something in her brain that wants her to keep checking things and checking things are off. She used to cook in the past and knows how to cook. She has no aids currently.

                - No diagnosis of a significant cognitive impairment that would affect this. The MSE found no evidence of cognitive impairment and she had adequate memory and concentration.<br>
                - She doesn't indicate low motivation and has no input from a psychiatrist or mental health nurse, the MSE found she did not appear to be withdrawn or require prompting.<br>
                Other descriptors supported by some evidence, with reasons why they have not been advised:<br>
                - The need for assistance has been considered and ruled out, she has no medication prescribed for severe pain, no input from rheumatology. She is still employed as a cleaner, she is currently on furlough but was working 12 hours per week over 5 days until March 2020, supporting adequate function to use aids rather than assistance.<br>
                Reasons why the descriptor I have advised is best supported by evidence:<br>
                Some difficulty reported is consistent with her diagnosis of fibromyalgia. She is prescribed medication for nerve pain and is known to the pain management team, though is currently just having phone calls with a clinical psychologist to manage her pain, she has nothing prescribed for more severe pain to suggest a greater restriction. She reports she is able to do things like make a sandwich, use a microwave and lift a kettle, suggesting adequate function to allow her to use aids. It is reasonable to suggest she requires aids to complete this reliably.            </dd>
