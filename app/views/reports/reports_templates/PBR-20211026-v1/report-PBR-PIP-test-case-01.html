  Has been a resident in supported housing for 3 years.</p>
<p>Experiences poor motivation, low mood, pain and discomfort right leg. She has a learning disability which affects understanding.
Staff provide daily prompting due to poor motivation, low mood, self-neglect, unkempt, inappropriate dressing for the weather, self- injurious behaviours and anxiety.</p><p>
She is able to read and understand words and pictures but has difficult reading letters due to her learning disability.
Has aids within flat including toilet aids and grab rails. Uses incontinence pads, requires prompting to change these and maintain personal hygiene.</p><p>
Goes to volunteer group at church and health centre - these are learnt routes and areas. People there know her and her conditions and will inform staff if she does not arrive and when she leaves. She lacks danger awareness and risk assessments are carried out before she undertakes these journeys.</p><p>

She travels in a private taxi from the same taxi company and same driver as they know her well. She is able
 to call Guy for support if she becomes too
 She sometimes needs money for items on these outings and carers will give her the correct amount such as bus fare as she would have difficulty working it out herself.</p><p>
Can walk up to 200metres however experience pain and discomfort after this. She then becomes slower and stops. She is prescribed pain relief gel for night time use.

    The customer questionnaire (CQ) reports a diagnosis of learning disability from birth, depression and anxiety for more than 30 years and arthritis in her right foot and leg for 15 years. Confirmed by the support worker telephone call (TC). The CQ also reports long term asthma and high blood pressure.</p>  <p style="padding-bottom:1em;">
      TC confirms symptoms of anxieties, self-injurious behaviours, self-neglect, poor motivation and low mood consistent with depression and anxiety. Also confirmed are further symptoms of pain and discomfort in her right leg consistent with arthritis.
